# odin-recipes

This project is an exercise for The Odin Project. The purpose is to bring all the knowledge I have acquired thus far into practice.

The website will be a multi-page recipe book, that will not be styled.

The skills I will have demonstrated fall under basic HTML-knowledge, basic Git-knowledge and general use of the command line and Visual Studio Code.
