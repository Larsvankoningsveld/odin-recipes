    <p>This smooth and creamy soup uses the often forgotten about root veggie celeriac (celery root). It has the texture of a potato, but with a celery-like flavor. Roasting the veggies brings out their natural sweetness. Use vegetable broth instead of chicken, for a vegetarian alternative.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds celeriac (celery root), peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>5 cups chicken broth, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>⅓ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>6 teaspoons truffle oil, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine celeriac, carrots, onion, and garlic in a large bowl. Sprinkle with Herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil and stir to combine evenly. Spread out vegetables on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Roast vegetables in the preheated oven until cooked through, stirring every 19 to 15 minutes, about 40 minutes total.</li>
        <li>Place roasted vegetables into a high-powered blender. Add 4 cups chicken broth and blend on high speed until smooth, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into a large saucepan over medium heat. Add remaining chicken broth and heat, stirring, until warmed through. Stir in heavy cream. Ladle soup into bowls and garnish with a light drizzle of truffle oil and a sprinkling of green onions.</li>
    </ol>
